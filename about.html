                <h1>About Aaisha Jamal</h1>
                <p>Hello, I’m Aaisha, a senior at the University of South Florida, pursuing dual degrees in Finance and Entrepreneurship with a minor in Nutrition. I’ve maintained a 4.0 GPA and multiple scholarships, reflecting my dedication. My summers are a blend of advanced coursework, internships, and global travel, showcasing my commitment and versatility. I’m passionate about empowering others through mentorship and initiatives like Assist2Advance, driven by my own experiences as the first in my family to attend school in the U.S.</p>
                <p>My journey combines academic rigor with hands-on experience. From financial modeling to strategic decision support, each role has reinforced my problem-solving skills. Looking ahead, I aim to blend my finance skills with entrepreneurial ventures and consulting. I invite you to explore my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaishajamal" target="_blank" class="resume-link">LinkedIn</a> for a detailed look at my achievements and experiences.</p>
